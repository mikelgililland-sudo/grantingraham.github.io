Phishing is one of the most common online scams today. Criminals pretend to be trusted companies,
government agencies, delivery services, banks, schools, or even family members — all to trick you
into sharing personal or financial information.

Phishing works because it feels personal and urgent. The message may warn of a problem with your
account, a missed delivery, a tax issue, or even something involving your child or grandchild.
The goal is simple: get you to react before you think.

This guide explains what phishing looks like — with real-world examples — and how parents and seniors
can protect themselves and their families.

## What is Phishing?

Phishing is when someone contacts you pretending to be a legitimate organization or person in order
to steal:

* Passwords and login details
* Bank or credit card information
* Social Security numbers
* Security codes
* Other sensitive information

Phishing shows up in:

* Email
* Text messages (smishing)
* Social media messages
* Fake websites
* Phone calls (vishing)

And the message almost always sounds urgent.

## Common Warning Signs to Look For

Be cautious if a message includes:

* Urgent or threatening language — “Immediate action required,” “Account suspended,” etc.
* Requests for personal or financial information
* Generic greetings — “Dear customer” instead of your name
* Strange links or attachments
* Spelling or formatting errors
* Email addresses that don’t match the real company

Trust your instincts — if something feels off, it probably is.

## Real-World Examples — Designed for Parents and Seniors

Seeing realistic examples makes phishing easier to recognize. Here are situations that commonly
target families and older adults.

### 1. “Your Bank Account Has Been Locked”

**Subject:** Urgent — Account Access Restricted

**From:** Security-team@yourbank-verify.com

*“We detected unusual activity on your bank account. Your account has been locked for your protection.
Click the link below to restore access.”*

#### Why this fools people

Money is emotional — scammers know this. They want you to panic and click fast.

#### Red flags

* The sender’s address is not your bank’s official domain
* The tone is threatening and urgent
* The link goes to a strange or misspelled website
* The email asks you to “verify” your identity

#### What to do instead

Go directly to your bank’s real website or app — do not use the link in the email.

### 2. “Delivery Attempt Failed — Fee Required”

**Subject:** Package Delivery Failed — Action Required

**From:** USPS-notify@parcel-center.com

*“We couldn’t deliver your package. Pay a $1.25 redelivery fee to complete shipment.”*

#### Why this works

Many people assume they forgot about an order.

#### Red flags

* Postal services do not charge tiny “handling fees” by email
* The link goes to a fake payment page
* The sender domain does not match the real carrier

If you really are expecting a package, go directly to the carrier’s official website to check.

### 3. “School or Parent Alert About Your Child”

**Subject:** Action Needed — Attendance Violation

**From:** noreply-schoolportal@edu-verify.com

*“Your child has been marked absent. Log in now to review disciplinary action.”*

#### Red flags

* You weren’t expecting this
* The email doesn’t mention your child by name
* The link looks suspicious

Always contact the school through known channels — not through the email.

### 4. “Grandparent Emergency Scam”

**Subject:** Please Don’t Tell Mom — I Need Help

*“Grandma, I’m in trouble and need money urgently. Please buy gift cards and send the codes.
I can’t talk right now.”*

#### Red flags

* Request for secrecy
* Emotional pressure
* Gift cards as payment

Always call your grandchild or another family member directly before acting — even if the message
sounds convincing.

### 5. “Account Will Be Deleted”

**Subject:** FINAL NOTICE — Email Account Closing

*“Your email account will be permanently deleted within 24 hours unless you verify your password now.”*

This usually leads to a fake login page created to steal your password.

If you did not request a reset — delete the message.

### 6. “IRS / Social Security Refund or Problem”

*“You must act immediately to avoid legal action.”*

*“We owe you a tax refund — enter your bank information.”*

#### Critical reminder

The IRS and Social Security do not email or text to demand payment or ask for bank info.

Hang up. Delete. Report.

## Practical Safety Steps for Parents & Seniors

If you are unsure about a message:

1. Do not click links or open attachments.
2. Verify independently. Use a known phone number or website.
3. Check the sender carefully. Look for misspellings or odd domains.
4. Pause and breathe. Scammers want you to react quickly.

## If You Think You May Have Been Phished

* Change your passwords immediately
* Turn on two-factor authentication
* Contact your bank or provider
* Monitor your accounts
* Run a security scan
* Let trusted family know what happened — there is no shame in being targeted

## A Final Word — Stay Calm, Stay Cautious

You do not need to be a technical expert to stay safe online. Most phishing attempts can be avoided
simply by slowing down, double-checking messages, and never sharing sensitive information unless you
are 100 percent certain the request is legitimate.

If something doesn’t feel right, stop and verify. It is always better to take a moment than to rush
and regret it later.
