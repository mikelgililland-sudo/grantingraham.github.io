*A calm, practical guide for parents and seniors*

Even when you try to be careful, mistakes happen. Maybe you clicked a link in an email that looked legitimate. Maybe you entered your password on a page that later turned out to be fake. Or maybe you downloaded an attachment that didn’t seem suspicious at the time — but now you’re worried.

**If that sounds familiar, take a deep breath.**

You are not alone — and there are clear steps you can take right now to protect yourself. This guide explains what to do next, in simple language, without panic or blame.

## First — Stay Calm and Don’t Be Embarrassed

Phishing attacks are designed to fool smart, cautious people. Criminals:

* Copy real company logos
* Use convincing language
* Create fake login screens that look identical to the real thing
* Add urgency so you feel rushed

So if you clicked something or entered information, it doesn’t mean you were careless. It means the scammer was convincing. The important thing now is what you do next.

## Step 1 — Disconnect and Stop Further Action

* Close the browser tab or email immediately
* Do not continue entering information
* If something begins installing, cancel it
* Consider turning off Wi-Fi temporarily

This helps limit the damage.

## Step 2 — Identify What Actually Happened

### Did you just click the link?

Many phishing links only lead to fake websites. If you did not enter any information or download anything, the risk is lower — but still continue reading.

### Did you enter login details?

If you typed in a password, assume the scammer now has it.

### Did you enter personal information?

Examples include:

* Social Security number
* Birthdate
* Bank or card info
* Security codes
* Driver’s license number

This requires stronger follow-up steps.

### Did something download or install?

This may indicate malware — especially on Windows or Android devices. You’ll want to run a full security scan.

## Step 3 — Change Your Passwords Immediately

Start with the affected account first — for example, your email, bank, or shopping site.

* Change the password on any other accounts that use the same password
* Create strong, unique passwords for each site
* Turn on two-factor authentication where available

This is one of the most important steps you can take.

## Step 4 — Secure Your Email First

Your email account is the “keys to the kingdom.” If scammers control your email, they can reset passwords on other accounts.

* Change your email password
* Turn on two-factor authentication
* Check your sent folder for suspicious messages
* Check account recovery settings for unknown phone numbers or backup emails

If anything looks strange — remove it.

## Step 5 — If You Shared Financial Information

* Contact your bank or credit card company immediately
* Explain that you may have given information to a phishing scam
* Ask them to flag your account and monitor activity
* They may issue you a new card

Most banks deal with this every day — they will guide you calmly.

## Step 6 — Run a Full Security Scan

* Run a full system scan using trusted antivirus software
* Update your device software
* Do not ignore warnings

If your device behaves strangely — pop-ups, unusual slowness, unknown programs — consider having a tech professional inspect it.

## Step 7 — Watch for Identity Theft Warning Signs

* New credit cards or accounts you didn’t open
* Unrecognized bank charges
* Password reset emails you didn’t request
* Mail from companies you don’t recognize

If you shared your Social Security number, consider placing a fraud alert or credit freeze with major credit bureaus.

## Step 8 — Report the Scam

You can report to:

* The company being impersonated
* Your bank
* Your email provider
* The FTC (U.S.) at reportfraud.ftc.gov

If workplace-related, notify your IT department immediately.

## A Special Note for Parents & Seniors

Scammers often target families and older adults because they know you care deeply about loved ones. If something frightened you into acting quickly — that was intentional.

You did nothing wrong by being trusting.

* You slowed down
* You took steps to secure your accounts
* You learned what to watch for next time

And please — do not feel embarrassed. Many good, intelligent people fall for these scams every day.

## When to Seek Extra Help

Consider talking to a trusted family member or professional if:

* You feel overwhelmed or unsure
* Your bank accounts show strange activity
* Your device continues to act unusual
* Large sums of money were involved

You do not have to handle this alone.

## Final Thought — Awareness Is Your Best Protection

Clicking a phishing link can feel scary — but with the right steps, you can protect yourself and move forward confidently. The goal is not perfection. It’s awareness, caution, and support.

**If something doesn’t feel right…  
Pause. Verify. Ask for help. Then act.**
