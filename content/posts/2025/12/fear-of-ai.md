Every wave of technological progress has come with a chorus of fear.

In **1970**, *The Atlantic* ran a piece titled **“The Threat of the Computer,”** warning:

> “Once computers are in charge of decisions, humans may find themselves merely spectators in their own affairs.”  
> — *Charles M. Hardin*, *The Atlantic*, Oct 1970

In **1982**, *TIME* put computers on the cover with a headline asking:

> “Will Your Job Become Obsolete?” — warning that automation could “eliminate millions of jobs and restructure society.”

By **1997**, *TIME* again sounded the alarm with its now-famous cover: **“The End of Privacy”**, predicting that:

> “The computer is watching. You may never be alone again.”

Fast forward to the 2020s, and the fear has grown more existential. A **2023 Pew Research Center** study found that:

* **52% of Americans** say they are “more concerned than excited” about the increased use of AI.
* Only **10% say they trust tech companies** to responsibly develop AI tools.

### But is it really the machines we should fear?

History tells us otherwise.

The danger isn’t the tool—it’s the **misuse** of the tool. AI, like the internet, electricity, and nuclear power, reflects the values and intentions of those who wield it.

> “Computers are not ‘intelligent’... they do not ‘think.’ It is we who project intelligence onto them.”  
> — *Joseph Weizenbaum*, *Computer Power and Human Reason*, 1976

Fear of the unknown is a natural, often wise response. It slows us down. It makes us think. But it shouldn’t stop us.

**Progress never arrives without risk. But it always arrives.**

We must proceed with caution—yes—but also with **courage**, **ethics**, and **human agency** at the helm.
