Average questions produce average answers. When you give ChatGPT better
instructions, you get clearer, more accurate, and more useful
responses. These three prompt techniques will instantly improve the
quality of your results.

## 1. Provide Clear Context

Start by telling ChatGPT who you are and what you are trying to do:
*“I am a beginner learning photo editing on my laptop…”*
Context helps the AI choose the right level of detail and language.

## 2. Set Helpful Limits

Add constraints so answers stay focused:
*“Explain in under 200 words, in numbered steps.”*
Limits on length, format, or reading level make the response easier to
use right away.

## 3. Ask It to Ask You Questions

End your prompt with:
*“Ask any clarifying questions before you answer.”*
This forces the AI to slow down and fill in missing details, leading to
more accurate and relevant help.

## 4. Turn These Ideas into a Reusable Template

Combine all three:
*“I am a beginner at \_\_\_\_. Explain in under 200 words, in steps, and
ask any clarifying questions before you answer.”*
Save this as a template and adjust it for each new topic you explore.

With just a bit more effort in your prompts, ChatGPT becomes much more
like a patient coach and less like a generic search result.
