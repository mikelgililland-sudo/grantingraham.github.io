AI Prompts by Grant Ingraham

## Skip the tech jargon and start *using* AI today.

If you’ve ever opened ChatGPT and thought, “Now what?”, this book is for you. *AI Prompts: Master ChatGPT Fast with Easy Prompts for Home, Work, and Creativity* is a hands-on guide written for everyday people—parents, retirees, students, small-business owners, and anyone who wants AI to make life easier, not more confusing. You’ll get step-by-step examples and ready-to-use prompts you can customize in seconds.

## Perfect if you’ve ever said…

* “I’m curious about AI but don’t know where to start.”
* “I don’t want theory—I want prompts I can actually use.”
* “I’m not technical. Just show me what to type in.”
* “I’d love help with writing, planning, brainstorming, and organizing.”
* “I want AI to save me time at home, at work, and in my creative hobbies.”

## What you’ll be able to do with this book

By the time you finish, you’ll know how to talk to ChatGPT like a helpful assistant instead of a mysterious black box. You’ll learn how to:

* Craft prompts that get clear, useful answers the first time
* Use AI to draft emails, letters, reports, and summaries
* Turn vague ideas into outlines, checklists, and action plans
* Brainstorm blog posts, social media content, book ideas, and more
* Plan trips, meals, parties, and projects with AI as your assistant
* Get AI to explain complex topics in plain English
* Avoid common pitfalls like “hallucinations” and misleading answers

## What’s inside *AI Prompts*

The book is divided into simple, focused sections so you can flip straight to what you need today. Inside, you’ll find:

* **ChatGPT Basics** – how to sign up, start a conversation, and stay safe.
* **Prompting 101** – simple formulas so you always know what to type.
* **Home & Everyday Life** – prompts for organization, letters, schedules, and problem-solving.
* **Work & Productivity** – prompts for emails, reports, meeting notes, and research help.
* **Creativity & Fun** – prompts for stories, art ideas, journaling, and hobbies.
* **Troubleshooting & Safety** – how to spot AI mistakes and fact-check results.

You’ll have hundreds of example prompts you can copy, paste, and adapt for your own life.

## Try a few prompts from the book

Here are just a few examples of the kinds of prompts you’ll find inside:

* “You are my friendly writing assistant. Help me write a polite email to [person] explaining [situation] in a calm, respectful tone. Keep it under 200 words.”
* “Help me plan a one-week schedule to work on [goal] 30 minutes per day. Include specific tasks for each day and a simple way to track progress.”
* “Explain [topic] to me as if I’m 12 years old. Use short paragraphs and everyday examples.”
* “Give me 10 creative ideas for [project: blog posts / social media posts / book chapter topics] focused on [audience].”
