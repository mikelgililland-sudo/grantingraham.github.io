Every modern iPhone with up‑to‑date iOS uses some form of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) in core apps. The most prominent examples include:

* Siri (virtual assistant)
* Messages (Genmoji, Smart Reply, Live Translation)
* Mail (summaries, Smart Reply)
* Photos (recognition, Memories, search)
* Notes (summarization)
* Keyboard & Dictation (predictions, speech‑to‑text)
* Translate (real‑time language translation)
* FaceTime & Phone (Live Translation)
* Shortcuts (contextual automation)

### Core iPhone Apps with Built‑in AI/ML Features

* Siri (Voice Assistant) — Uses AI for natural language understanding, voice queries, context retention, recommendations, and more. Siri’s capabilities include voice recognition, language understanding, and intelligent task execution.
* Messages — AI‑enhanced features such as Genmoji creation, live translation, Smart Replies, and contextual suggestions.
* Mail — AI‑powered message summaries, Smart Reply, and intelligent sorting (with Apple Intelligence enabled).
* Photos — Intelligent photo analysis and recommendations. The Photos app uses machine learning for object/scene recognition, Memories creation, and sorting, enhanced further with Apple Intelligence.
* Notes — AI‑assisted summarization and text transformation.
* Keyboard / Dictation — AI‑based typing predictions, autocorrect, and speech‑to‑text. The system keyboard uses language models to improve autocorrect and predictive text; Dictation uses on‑device speech‑to‑text models.
* Translate — AI‑driven language translation using neural models for text and voice translations.
* FaceTime — Live Translation captions and intelligent audio features.
* Shortcuts — Intelligent action suggestions and automation that can be AI‑enhanced.
* Phone/Calling features — AI‑augmented Live Translation and transcription enhancements.

### System‑Wide AI/ML Capabilities Impacting Multiple Built‑In Apps

* Apple Intelligence — Built‑in AI system that provides generative and analytical capabilities used across apps like Mail, Messages, Photos, Notes, Translate, and more.
* On‑Device Machine Learning and Core ML — Underlying frameworks used by native apps for features such as object recognition, suggestions, and personalization.
* Live Text & Visual Recognition — System AI that lets you extract text from images and interact with it (works in Photos, Camera, Safari, and other apps).
