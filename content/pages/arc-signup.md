## What I Ask From You

I want this to be simple and enjoyable. Here’s all I ask of ARC members:

* **Read the book** (or as much as you reasonably can) before launch.
* **Share honest feedback** if you spot errors or confusing sections.
* **Post an honest review** on Amazon (and optionally Goodreads) when the book is released.
* **Note that you received a free ARC copy** if required by review guidelines.
