### Interactive AI Tool

**AI Prompt Coach** is an interactive tool I created to help everyday users
learn how to write clearer, more effective prompts for tools like ChatGPT.
Instead of guessing what to ask, the Coach helps you understand
*why prompts work* and how to improve them step by step.

Built on the same framework I explain in my book *AI Prompts*, the AI Prompt Coach
is especially helpful for beginners, seniors, parents, educators, and anyone who feels
frustrated by vague or inconsistent AI results.
