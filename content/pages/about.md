# About Grant Ingraham

I write calm, practical guides about **AI** and **online safety**
for everyday people — parents, seniors, beginners, and anyone who feels overwhelmed by modern technology.

I’m an engineer by training and an author by choice. After decades working with technology, safety, and systems that affect real people, I saw a growing problem; technology was advancing faster than everyday understanding.

Parents were worried about their kids online. Seniors were afraid of scams. Beginners felt embarrassed asking basic questions. And most advice available was either overly technical, fear-driven, or written for experts.

I started writing because I believed there was a better way — one built on clarity, patience, and respect for the reader.

## Why I Write These Books

My goal is not to make people “experts.” It’s to help them feel **confident enough to make good decisions**.

That means explaining technology in plain language, avoiding hype and fear, and focusing on practical habits that actually improve safety and understanding.

If a reader finishes one of my books feeling calmer, more informed, and less intimidated by technology, then the book has done its job.

## My Books

My writing focuses on two core areas:

* **Cybersecurity for everyday users** — protecting yourself from scams, managing passwords, browsing safely, and understanding online risks without technical jargon.
* **Artificial intelligence for beginners** — explaining what AI is (and isn’t), how it’s already used in daily life, and how families can approach it safely and responsibly.

## Who This Is For

My work is written especially for:

* Parents and grandparents navigating technology with their families
* Seniors who want to stay safe and independent online
* Beginners who want clear explanations without judgment
* Anyone who prefers calm guidance over hype or fear
