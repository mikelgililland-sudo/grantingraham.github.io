This beginner-friendly guide shows simple steps for online safety, including how to protect yourself from scams,

* “I’m not technical—I just want simple, safe habits.”
* “I worry about scams, but I don’t know what to look for.”
* “I bank and shop online… how do I do it safely?”
* “My passwords are a mess and I need a better system.”
* “I want to protect my family without living in fear.”

## Designed for everyday users, not IT professionals

* Parents who want to protect their children online
* New computer users learning modern digital safety
* Anyone who has been scammed—or worried about being scammed
* Small business owners who want quick, practical guidance
* People who want simple, everyday steps to reduce risk

## What you’ll be able to do after reading

This book teaches the practical, real-world skills that prevent the most common online problems:

* Spot scams, fake websites, and phishing attacks
* Protect your passwords and accounts the right way
* Avoid “too good to be true” offers that steal your data
* Secure your phone, laptop, and home Wi-Fi
* Manage privacy settings on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and more
* Identify safe vs. unsafe links, downloads, and email attachments

* Keep children and grandchildren safer online with easy-to-follow steps

## What’s inside *Cybersecurity: How to Be Secure*

The book is divided into clear, easy-to-read chapters that help you take control of your online safety immediately.

* **The Foundations of Online Safety**
* **Scams, Phishing, and Identity Theft**
* **Safe Browsing Habits**

## A few safety tips from inside the book

Use these right away to improve your online security:

* Never click a link in an email claiming your account is “locked”—log in manually from the official site instead.
* Use passphrases instead of passwords: something like *Mint-Cathedral-Picnic-47*.
* Be suspicious of urgent messages from “friends or family” asking for money—call them directly to confirm.
* Update your phone and computer when prompted—most updates fix security holes criminals exploit.
* On public Wi-Fi at coffee shops or airports, avoid logging into banking or shopping accounts.

## Free bonus checklists and tools included
