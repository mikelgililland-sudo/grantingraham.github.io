## How Parents Should Use AI for Schoolwork Support

Used responsibly, AI can act like a patient tutor or study guide. It should support **thinking**, not replace it.

### AI can help as a:

* Patient tutor (explaining concepts in new ways)
* Study guide (practice questions and review)
* Clarity tool (rephrasing confusing directions)
* Planning aid (breaking assignments into steps)

### AI should not be used as:

* An answer machine for graded work
* A shortcut that bypasses learning
* A replacement for effort or honesty

**Rule of thumb:** Ask AI to *explain*, *coach*, or *quiz*—not to “solve.”

If your teen could not explain the answer out loud, the work is not truly theirs yet.

## 7 Safe Prompts Parents Can Use (With “Why It Works” + “Watch Out For”)

These prompts are designed to keep your teen involved and learning. Replace the bracketed parts with your situation.

### Prompt 1: Explain a Concept at a Teen’s Level

**Use this when:** Your teen doesn’t understand a topic, even after reading the assignment.

**Prompt**

Explain this concept in simple terms for a **[grade level]** student. Assume no prior background.
Use two everyday examples and a short summary at the end.  
**Topic:** [insert topic]

**Why this works:** AI is strong at rephrasing explanations at different difficulty levels.

**Watch out for:** Explanations can be oversimplified or incomplete. Encourage follow-up questions.

### Prompt 2: Help a Teen Get Unstuck (Without Giving the Answer)

**Use this when:** Your teen understands part of the problem but doesn’t know the next step.

**Prompt**

Act like a tutor. Help a student think through the **next step** without giving the final answer.
Ask me 2–3 questions first to see what I already understand.  
**Problem description:** [describe the assignment]

**Why this works:** It forces coaching and questioning instead of solution-dumping.

**Watch out for:** If the AI starts solving, stop and say: “No final answer—only hints and questions.”

### Prompt 3: Turn an Assignment Into a Simple Study Plan

**Use this when:** Your teen feels overwhelmed and doesn’t know where to start.

**Prompt**

Break this assignment into 6–10 manageable steps a student can follow.
Include suggested time estimates and checkpoints to confirm understanding.  
**Assignment:** [paste or summarize]

**Why this works:** AI is excellent at organizing tasks into clear sequences.

**Watch out for:** Time estimates may be unrealistic—adjust to your teen’s schedule and pace.

### Prompt 4: Rephrase Confusing Directions in Plain English

**Use this when:** Instructions feel unclear, overly academic, or vague.

**Prompt**

Rewrite these assignment instructions in plain English for a student.
Then list the required deliverables as a checklist.  
**Instructions:** [paste here]

**Why this works:** AI is strong at translating formal language into everyday language.

**Watch out for:** If requirements are still unclear, verify with the teacher rather than guessing.

### Prompt 5: Practice for a Test (Questions + Feedback)

**Uses this when:** Your teen wants to review material without being “taught at.”

**Prompt**

Quiz me with 10 practice questions on **[topic]** at a **[grade level]**.
After each answer, tell me what I did well and what to review. Keep feedback encouraging.  
**Topic:** [insert topic]

**Why this works:** Retrieval practice builds real understanding and memory.

**Watch out for:** Questions may not match the exact curriculum—use as practice, not prophecy.

### Prompt 6: Check Understanding (Without Solving)

**Use this when:** You want to confirm whether your teen understands the concept.

**Prompt**

Ask me 8 questions that test understanding of **[topic]**.
Do not give answers unless I ask. If I’m confused, offer a hint and a simpler explanation.  
**Topic:** [insert topic]

**Why this works:** It keeps the teen thinking and explaining—key to real learning.

**Watch out for:** Encourage your teen to answer in their own words, not “repeat the AI.”

### Prompt 7: Explain “Why This Method Works”

**Use this when:** Your teen can follow steps but doesn’t understand the reasoning.

**Prompt**

Explain why this method works, step by step, in a way a **[grade level]** student can understand.
Include one simple example and one common mistake to avoid.  
**Method/problem type:** [describe]

**Why this works:** Understanding “why” improves retention and reduces dependence.

**Watch out for:** AI can be confidently wrong—verify with the textbook or teacher notes when needed.

## Safety and Integrity Guidelines for Parents

AI can support learning, but it can also undermine it if used as a shortcut. These guidelines keep your family on solid ground:

* **Follow school policies** on AI use (they vary widely).
* **Don’t submit AI-generated work** as the student’s original work.
* **Keep your teen involved**: ask them to explain what they learned out loud.
* **Verify important facts** with the textbook, teacher materials, or reliable sources.
* **Avoid sensitive data**: do not paste names, student IDs, medical details, or private information.
