*If you manage both a personal identity and a public author identity on Facebook, as I do, you’ll often feel like you’re seeing “the same page” in multiple places. You aren’t. Facebook is showing different **views** of the same underlying presence—each view has its own purpose, permissions, and audience.*

This page covers the five common views and how you reach each one:

1. [My Profile (Michael Gililland)](#view1)
2. [Page View (Grant Ingraham)](#view2)
3. [Home Feed (while acting as the Page)](#view3)
4. [Professional Dashboard](#view4)
5. [Search Result View](#view5)

*In Part 2, we’ll explain why these views matter and why Facebook has so many paths that seem to lead to the same place.*

## 1) My Profile — the personal identity layer

**What it is:** Your personal profile (Michael Gililland) is your private, human identity on Facebook. This is where friendships, personal interactions, and everyday life typically live.

**How it is reached:** You arrive here by default when you log into Facebook. You can typically return to it by clicking your profile picture in the top-right area of Facebook.

## 2) Page View — the public author identity (Grant Ingraham)

**What it is:** Your Facebook Page is your public-facing author identity. It’s designed for followers (not friends), broad visibility, and a consistent public voice.

**How it is reached (your two common paths):**

1. From your personal profile, switch your identity to “Grant Ingraham” (acting as the Page).
2. Once on the Page environment, click the Grant Ingraham profile image (top-left area) to land on the main Page view.

## 3) Home Feed (as the Page) — your Page’s social operating view

**What it is:** This is the Home feed experience while you are acting as the Page. It’s not the same as your personal feed. It’s Facebook’s attempt to give your Page a “social environment” of its own.

**How it is reached:** While on the Grant Ingraham Page identity, click the **Home** button/icon.

## 4) Professional Dashboard — the management and analytics center

**What it is:** The Professional Dashboard is where Facebook puts tools that treat your Page like a public-facing property: insights, settings, distribution tools, and performance tracking.

**How it is reached:** From the Grant Ingraham Page, select **Professional dashboard**.

## 5) Search Result View — how people discover your Page

**What it is:** This is the discovery view. Someone can search “Grant Ingraham” and encounter your Page as a first impression.

**How it is reached:** Search for “Grant Ingraham” from any Facebook context (another profile, another page, or your own Home feed).
