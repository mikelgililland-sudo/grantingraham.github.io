# Avoiding Online Scams: How to Spot Fraud Before It’s Too Late

Online scams are no longer obvious or rare. They are carefully designed to look legitimate,
urgent, and personal—targeting everyday users such as parents, seniors, and beginners.
This page explains the most common online scams, the warning signs to watch for, and
simple decision rules that can protect you before real damage occurs.
**Key takeaway:** Most scams succeed not because of technology,
but because they exploit fear, urgency, and trust.

## What Are Online Scams? (Quick Answer)

**Online scams are fraudulent attempts to trick people into giving away money,
personal information, or account access by pretending to be a trusted source.**
They typically arrive through email, text messages, phone calls, social media,
or fake websites.

## Why Online Scams Work So Well

Scammers do not rely on advanced hacking. They rely on predictable human reactions.

* Urgency (“Act now or your account will be closed”)
* Fear (“Suspicious activity detected”)
* Authority (“This is your bank / tech support / government agency”)
* Trust (“I’m a friend who needs help”)

The goal is always the same: push you to act before you stop and think.

## Phishing Emails and Text Messages

**Phishing** uses fake messages that appear to come from legitimate organizations.
These messages usually contain links that lead to fake websites designed to steal login credentials.
Common phishing themes include:

* Package delivery problems
* Password resets
* Account security alerts
* Unusual login warnings

**Rule:** If you did not initiate the contact, do not click the link.
Go directly to the organization’s official website instead.

## Fake Bank and Financial Alerts

Scammers frequently impersonate banks, credit card companies, and payment services.
These messages claim there is a problem with your account that requires immediate action.
**Banks do not ask for passwords, PINs, or verification codes by email or text.**
Safe response:

* Do not reply
* Do not click links
* Log in using your bank’s official app or website
* Call the number on the back of your card if concerned

## Tech Support Scams

Tech support scams often begin with alarming pop-ups, emails, or phone calls claiming
your computer is infected or compromised.
They attempt to convince you to:

* Call a phone number
* Install remote access software
* Pay for unnecessary or fake services

**Rule:** Legitimate technology companies do not cold-call users
about security problems.

## Romance and Marketplace Scams

These scams rely on trust rather than fear and often develop slowly.

### Romance Scams

* Emotional connection builds over time
* Eventually involves money, emergencies, or investments
* Requests for secrecy are common

### Marketplace Scams

* Requests to move conversations off-platform
* Fake payments or overpayments
* Pressure to act quickly

**Warning:** Requests for gift cards, cryptocurrency, or wire transfers
are major red flags.

## Common Scam Red Flags

* Urgency or threats
* Requests for secrecy
* Pressure to act immediately
* Requests for personal or financial information
* Untraceable payment methods

## Simple Decision Rules That Stop Most Scams

1. **Slow down.** Scammers rely on speed.
2. **Verify independently.** Use known websites or phone numbers.
3. **Never share passwords or codes.**
4. **When in doubt, do nothing.**
