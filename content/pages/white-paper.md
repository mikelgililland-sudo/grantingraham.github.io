# The White Paper (For Builders, Not Browsers)

A practical strategy document for people who want to teach AI safely, build trust, and sell useful resources.  
**Grant Ingraham**

This is **not** a general “what is AI?” handout. It is a behind-the-scenes guide for people who are building a program, content library, course, newsletter, community, or book-based platform around AI education.

## Before you download: who benefits most?

You will get the most value from this PDF if you are trying to **reach and teach everyday people** about AI while also creating a sustainable revenue path (books, resources, consulting, training, or memberships).

## What’s Inside the White Paper

The PDF is a strategy document. It explains how to reach everyday users who feel overwhelmed by AI, teach them safely using real-life tasks, and build a revenue path without hype or gimmicks.

* **Audience reality:** why most people struggle with AI and what they actually need.
* **Trust-first positioning:** how to address fear without debating skeptics.
* **Task-based teaching:** “help me do this today” beats abstract explanations.
* **Content that converts:** posts and pages that route readers toward books and resources.
* **Simple metrics:** what to track so you can improve without extra overhead.
* **Boundaries:** where AI should *not* be used (legal/medical/financial/safety-critical).

### Important note

If you are simply curious about AI, this PDF may feel too “behind the curtain.” It is meant for people building a plan, a platform, or a product.
