## Quick Start Checklist: 10 High-Impact Security Wins

If you do nothing else, do these. They reduce your risk immediately—without needing technical knowledge.

1. **Turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for email and banking.
2. **Use a password manager** and stop reusing passwords.
3. **Update** your phone and computer (automatic updates on).
4. **Lock your phone** with a strong PIN (not 1234) and enable biometrics.
5. **Back up** important photos and documents (cloud + one local copy).
6. **Pause before clicking** links in email/text—go to the site directly instead.
7. **Check bank/credit statements** weekly (set alerts where possible).
8. **Secure your home Wi-Fi** (unique router password; WPA2/WPA3).
9. **Review privacy settings** on social media and limit public info.
10. **Make a recovery plan** (what to do if an account is compromised).

## Foundations: How Attacks Work (So You Can Stop Them)

Most online attacks succeed for the same reason: they bypass technology by exploiting people. When you understand the patterns, you stop being surprised—and you start spotting danger early.

### The 3 Things Attackers Want

* **Your identity** (SSN, DOB, accounts)
* **Your money** (banking, cards, payments)
* **Your access** (email, phone number, logins)

### The 4 Common Paths In

* Phishing links and fake logins
* Stolen/reused passwords
* Infected downloads and fake updates
* Social engineering (urgency, fear, authority)

### Your Best Defense

* Slow down and verify
* Use MFA everywhere it matters
* Unique passwords via a manager
* Backups + recovery steps

## Passwords & Account Protection

Password reuse is the #1 reason ordinary people get hacked. The fix is straightforward; a password manager plus MFA, starting with your email account.

### What to do

* Choose a password manager and use it daily.
* Turn on MFA for email, banking, and social accounts.
* Replace reused passwords with unique ones (start with your most important accounts).
* Enable account alerts for new logins and password changes.

### What to avoid

* Reusing “one good password” everywhere.
* Keeping passwords in notes, spreadsheets, or on paper near your computer.
* Using SMS MFA when better options exist (authenticator apps or security keys).

## Scams, Phishing & Social Engineering

Scam messages are engineered to create urgency: “Your account will be closed,” “You owe money,” “Act now.” The winning move is to slow down, verify independently, and never “resolve” issues through a link in a message.

### Red Flags

* Urgency, threats, or “limited time” pressure
* Requests for codes, gift cards, crypto, wire transfers
* “Your package is delayed” with a random link
* Unusual sender addresses or misspellings

### Safe Verification

* Type the website yourself (don’t click)
* Call the number on the back of your card
* Use the official app, not email links
* Ask a trusted person before acting

### Family Protection

* Create a family “verification phrase”
* Agree: no money transfers under pressure
* Teach kids the same red flags
* Set financial alerts on accounts

## Device Safety: Phones, Computers, and Home Wi-Fi

Your phone and email are the “master keys” to your digital life. Secure those first, then secure your network.

### Phone essentials

* Use a strong passcode; enable Face ID / Touch ID.
* Turn on automatic updates.
* Review app permissions (location, contacts, photos).
* Enable “Find My” (iPhone) / “Find My Device” (Android).

### Computer essentials

* Automatic OS and browser updates.
* Use reputable anti-malware (or built-in protections kept updated).
* Install software only from trusted sources.
* Backups: at least one offline/local copy.

### Home Wi-Fi essentials

* Change the router admin password (not the Wi-Fi name/password).
* Use WPA2/WPA3; avoid WEP.
* Disable WPS if you don’t need it.
* Create a guest network for visitors and smart devices.

Your best tools are alerts, strong authentication, and a consistent routine for reviewing activity. The goal is early detection and fast response.

### High-Impact Settings

* Transaction alerts (text/app/email)
* MFA on bank and email accounts
* Credit card virtual numbers (if offered)
* Daily/weekly account review

* Freeze card / dispute quickly
* Document dates, times, and actions

### Safe Banking Articles

* Safe Banking Online (Coming Soon)
* Venmo/Cash App/Zelle Safety (Coming Soon)

## Social Media & Privacy: Share Less, Control More

Social platforms are useful—but they are also rich sources of personal data used in scams and account takeovers. The goal is not to quit; it’s to control what you share and who can reach you.

### Privacy moves that matter

* Limit who can see your posts and personal details.
* Hide your friend list (when possible).
* Disable/limit DMs from strangers.
* Remove old posts that reveal birthdates, addresses, routines.

### Account protection

* Unique password + MFA.
* Review logged-in sessions/devices.
* Be skeptical of “friend” requests from familiar names.

### Privacy Articles (Coming Soon)

* Privacy Settings: The Simple Walkthrough
* Impersonation Scams: “Is This Really You?”
* What Not to Post (and why scammers love it)

## Shopping Online: Avoid Fraud, Fake Sites, and Counterfeits

Online shopping is convenient, but it’s full of traps: fake storefronts, “too good to be true” prices, and look-alike websites. A few verification habits prevent most losses.

### Verify the Seller

* Look for a real address and support contact
* Search the store name + “reviews” + “scam”
* Be cautious with brand-new domains
* Use payment methods with protections

### Watch for Fake Sites

* Misspelled domains (look closely)
* Odd checkout behavior or forced “account creation”
* Unusual payment demands (gift cards, crypto)
* Heavy pressure: “Only 3 left!” everywhere

### Safer Habits

* Use a dedicated shopping email alias (optional)
* Virtual card numbers (if available)
* Save order confirmations
* Set delivery alerts

## Identity Theft & Recovery Plan

The difference between a minor incident and a long-term headache is speed and process. This section is a practical “what to do next” path you can keep on hand.

### If an account is compromised

1. Secure your email account first (password + MFA).
2. Change the compromised password (unique, via password manager).
3. Log out of other sessions/devices.
4. Review forwarding rules and recovery options.
5. Check financial accounts and set alerts.

### If money is involved

* Call your bank/card issuer using official numbers.
* Dispute unauthorized transactions quickly.
* Document everything: dates, names, case numbers.

### Recommended “Recovery Kit”

* Printed list of key accounts and recovery methods (kept secure)
* Credit freeze instructions for the major bureaus
* Backup codes stored safely
* Trusted family contact plan

## FAQ

**Do I really need a password manager?**

If you have more than a handful of accounts, yes. Unique passwords are one of the strongest protections you can add. A manager makes “unique and strong” practical—without relying on memory.

**Is MFA worth the hassle?**

For email and financial accounts, MFA is one of the highest-value steps you can take. It blocks many attacks even when a password is stolen.

**What is the single most important account to protect?**

Your primary email account. It is used to reset passwords for nearly everything else. Secure it first with a unique password and MFA.

**How do I know if a message is a scam?**

Look for urgency, unusual payment requests, and links asking you to “verify.” When in doubt, do not click—go to the official website or app yourself.
